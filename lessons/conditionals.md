## Warmup Exercise 

Write a program that reads a password. If the user enters `123` output `are you serious?`, if the user enters `abc` output `No Way!`. Otherwise, print `OK!`.

## Exercise 1

You'd like to write a program that reads a student's grade and prints the corresponding letter grade. You used DeepSeek, Gemini, ChatGPT, and Claude and each gave a different piece of code. Which one is correct?

> These are just hypothetical pieces of code that were not generated by any GenAI tool.

<details class="jtd-accordion">
  <summary>Solution</summary>
<ul>
    <li> <b>DeepSeek</b>. Prints <code>A+AB</code> if <code>grade >= 100</code> and prints <code>AB</code> if <code>90 <= grade < 100</code>.</li>
    <li> <b>Gemini</b>.Prints an <code>F</code> if <code>grade >= 90</code>.</li>
    <li> <b>Claude</b>. Correct!</li>
    <li> <b>ChatGPT</b>. Correct, but is poor style because the <code>and</code> part is useless given that we are using <code>elif</code>.</li>
</ul>
</details>

## Exercise 2

What is wrong with the following piece of code? How can we fix it?
```python
if temp > 20:
    print("Hot")
elif temp > 25:
    print("Warm")
else:
    print("Cold")
```
<details class="jtd-accordion">
  <summary>Solution</summary>
This code will never print <code>Warm</code>. To fix it, we need to swap the first condition with the second.
</details>

## Exercise 3

Write a program that reads three integers and prints the maximum.

{% include expandable-code.html
title="Solution 1"
id="max3_1"
language="python"
file='code/max3_1.py'
%}

{% include expandable-code.html
title="Solution 2"
id="max3_2"
language="python"
file='code/max3_2.py'
%}

{% include expandable-code.html
title="Solution 3"
id="max3_3"
language="python"
file='code/max3_3.py'
%}

Which of these solutions do you find more **_readable_**?

## Exercise 4

{: .highlight-title }
> ðŸ’¡ **NOTE**
>
> This exercise is for practice only and should not be understood to mean that you should avoid using operators `and` and `or`. On the contrary, such operators make the code much more readable.

### Exercise 4.1

Rewrite the following piece of code **without** using `and`, `or`, or `not`. 

```python
if x == 1 and y == 1:
    print("Both are 1")
else:
    print("At least one is not 1")
```

{% include expandable-code.html
title="Solution 1"
id="and_1"
language="python"
file='code/and_1.py'
%}

The following two solutions are incorrect, what is wrong with each of them?

**Non-Solution 1**.
```python
if x == 1:
    if y == 1:
        print("Both Are 1")
    else:
        print("At least one is not 1")
```

<details class="jtd-accordion">
  <summary>Explanation</summary>
Nothing will be printed if <code>x !=1 1</code>.
</details><br>

**Non-Solution 2**.
```python
if x == 1:
    if y == 1:
        print("Both Are 1")
else:
    print("At least one is not 1")
```

<details class="jtd-accordion">
  <summary>Explanation</summary>
Nothing will be printed if <code>x == 1</code> and <code>y != 1</code>.
</details><br>

{% include expandable-code.html
title="Corrected Code"
id="and_4"
language="python"
file='code/and_4.py'
%}

While this code is correct, it is not as clean as the first solution we proposed above.

### Exercise 4.2

Rewrite the following piece of code so that they do **not** use `and`, `or`, or `not`. 

```python
if x == 1:
    print("At least one is 1")
elif y == 1:
    print("At least one is 1")
else:
    print("Oops!")
```
