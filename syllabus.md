## Course Overview

Welcome! This course is a gentle (and hopefully fun) introduction to computing. We will use programming in Python as a vehicle for introducing some fundamentals of the field. As you learn how to program, you will develop skills that you need in your future courses and also explore applicatoins in various computing areas, such as artificial intelligence, computer security, and image processing. You will also begin to appreciate what it takes to design and build large software systems. In short, this course will give you a taste of computing and prepare you for what lies ahead.

## Prerequisites

No prior programming experience is expected. Just bring your curiosity, a commitment to practice regularly, and enough perseverance to keep going when things get tricky.

## Textbooks

We will use the following two textbooks, both of which are available online for free. We will also use slides, notes, and other resources as necessary. The <a href='/11102-f25/schedule'>Schedule</a> page will learning material and which chapter(s) from which book are required.

## Course Topics

The first 7 weeks of the semester will focus on programming in Python. Each of the remaining weeks will focus on an application area in computer science using hands-on projects and examples. Here is what you should expect to achieve by the end of the semester:

- Be able to **_read, trace, and modify_** simple programs in Python. 
- Be able to **_design and test_** small/medium-sized programs in Python.
- Understand how **_information is represented_** and stored on computers.
- Understand how to **_compare different algorithms_** for solving a problem.
- Perform basic **_manipulations of images_** using Python.
- Understand basic concepts in **_computer security_** like data integrity and confidentiality.
- Understand basic concepts related **_machine learning and data analysis_**.
